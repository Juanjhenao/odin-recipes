     <p>Full of flavor with a hint of sweetness, this moist and delicious salmon is ready in under 10 minutes! <br>
         You may want to add salt before serving if you are using an unsalted Cajun seasoning. <br>
         I like to use a MistoÂ® sprayer with my own oil, but feel free to use regular cooking spray. <br>
         For best results, use center-cut fillets that are about an inch thick.</p>
         
         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) skin-on salmon fillets</li>
    <li>cooking spray</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Cajun seasoning</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
         </ul>
    
         <h3>Steps</h3>
         <ol>
    <li>Preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Rinse and dry salmon fillets with a paper towel. Mist fillets with cooking spray. <br>
        Combine Cajun seasoning and brown sugar in a small bowl. Sprinkle onto a plate. <br>
         Press flesh sides of fillets into the seasoning mixture.</li>

    <li>Spray the basket of the air fryer with cooking spray and place salmon fillets skin-side down. <br>
              Mist salmon again lightly with cooking spray.</li>

    <li>Cook for 8 minutes. Remove from air fryer and let rest for 2 minutes before serving.</li>
            
         </ol>
